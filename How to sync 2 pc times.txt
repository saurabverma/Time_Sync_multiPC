Design: Mr. Saurab Verma

It is assumed that "slave" computer gets the time from a "master" computer.
All the following commands are run on slave pc.

Prior to syncing time, with root login on slave pc, allow other local users to change time using the following command:

  $setcap cap_sys_time=ep /bin/date

The following command confirms 

  $getcap /bin/date

Next, use the following command to get the time from master pc and set it on the slave pc (type master pc password if necessary):

  $date -s $(ssh isera2@master "date +%T")

Note that this command can be run periodically, just to ensure that both computer times are in sync and drift effects are minimal.
